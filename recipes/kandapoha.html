    <p><h3>Description:</h3></p>
    <p>This is Maharashtian's staple breakfast and is prolly the better out of the Indian breakfast wars</p>
    <p>This dish is basically flavoured steamed flattened rice, topped with special Indian condiments and fairly easy to make!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Poha/Flattened Rice</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Chopped Onion</li>
        <li>Curry Leaves</li>
        <li>Mustard Seeds</li>
        <li>Raw Peanuts</li>
        <li>Chopped Green Chillies</li>
        <li>Turmeric Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Rinse 1.5 cups thick poha (flattened rice) in water until they soften. Use a strainer or colander to rinse these light rice flakes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Drain all of the water. The pohe should loose their crunchiness, crispiness and when you break them between your finger, they should easily get crushed or mashed. Set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Now add 1 teaspoon sugar (or as required), salt as per taste, and ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder to the pohe and gently mix with a spoon or with clean hands. </p></li>
        <li><p>Dry roast 2 to 2.5 tablespoons peanuts in a heavy pan until they become crunchy.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in the same pan. Crackle the mustard seeds first. Use peanut oil or sunflower oil or any neutral flavored oil. </p></li>
        <li><p>Then add ½ cup finely chopped onions. Sauté them until they become translucent and soften. </p></li>
        <li><p>Add 10 to 12 curry leaves and 1 teaspoon chopped green chilies. Sauté for some seconds.</p></li>
        <li><p> Add the roasted peanuts and stir.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add poha and mix gently. </p></li>
        <li><p>Switch off the heat and let poha remain covered for 1 to 2 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove the lid and sprinkle 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 2 to 3 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves and 2 to 3 tablespoons grated coconut.</p></li>
        <li><p>Mix gently and serve. </p></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>If you want a much better experience pair it with simple Curd or warm Tea while you push your agenda on which is the better breakfast on r/pune</p>
